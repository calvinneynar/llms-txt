# Neynar

> Neynar is the easiest infrastructure platform for building on Farcaster, a decentralized social protocol. It provides APIs, SDKs, tools for creating Farcaster applications including social data integration, mini apps (Frames), AI agents, onchain data analysis, and client development.

Neynar abstracts away the complexity of interacting with Farcaster hubs and provides:

- **Social Data APIs**: Access Farcaster user profiles, social graphs, feeds, and follower/following relationships
- **Frames (Mini Apps)**: Build, validate, and host Farcaster mini apps with real-time analytics and push notifications  
- **AI Agents**: Deploy contextual AI agents with automated real-time interactions on Farcaster
- **Onchain Data**: Get token balances, relevant holders, and personalized blockchain data from FIDs or wallet addresses
- **Data Services**: Access real-time data, stream events, and manage databases for advanced analytics and integrations
- **Data Analytics**: Access real-time Farcaster data streams, indexed databases, and analytics tools
- **Hub Services**: Reliable hub endpoints, webhooks, and indexer-as-a-service for streaming Farcaster data

Key Farcaster concepts: Users have permanent FIDs (numerical identifiers), create "casts" (similar to tweets), and build social graphs through following relationships.
